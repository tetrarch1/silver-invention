My Directed Reading Program with Anup Poudel and Nyah Davis.
To operate it conveniently, use the function ptb.
ptb takes two integer arguments. It constructs two Pascal matrices of sizes corresponding to these arguments.
From there, the function converts the matrix to semi-standard Young tableaux, multiplies the P and Q tableaux together,
then gets a new matrix out of that new tableau. The function returns this matrix and the same matrix mod 2.
